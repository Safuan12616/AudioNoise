<h2>Basic usage</h2>

<table width=50%>
<tr><td>
<ol>
  <li> At section <i>Input</i>, it is possible to select either a local file to upload or one of the demo files stored on the server.<br><br>
  <li> Pressing the <b>Start</b> button uploads any selected local file and processes the input file using the default noise reduction settings (or the currently selected ones, if "Fix settings for another file" is checked). A progress bar shows the progress of the upload.<br><br>
  <li> Of the two audio players that appear at section <i>Output</i>, the upper one plays the original input file while the lower one plays the latest noise reduction result. The latter can be downloaded by pressing the <b>Download</b> button.<br><br>
  <li> If noise reduction quality of the output needs to be improved: denoising parameters can be adjusted in section <i>Settings</i>, followed by either:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li> Keeping the radio button next to the original input file player checked before pressing <b>Process</b>. This runs a different noise reduction operation on the original input.<br><br>
      <li> Checking the radio button next to the output file player before pressing <b>Process</b>. This applies a subsequent processing phase on the output of the previous phase. With this option, each processing phase gives a different output even if settings are otherwise unchanged.<br><br>
    </ul>
  <li> To return to previous output, press <b>Previous version</b>. The settings will also change to reflect the previous configuration. Pressing <b>Previous version</b> another time switches back to the newer version.<br><br>
  <li> The buttons in the beginning of section <i>Settings</i> can be used to select preset configurations. The default configuration when uploading a new file corresponds to button <b>1</b>.<br><br>
  <li> Longer recordings may take a while to process. It may take up to two minutes for the result to first appear after the uploading has finished. The audio player then updates automatically as more of the processed output becomes ready. If it stops updating and does not show the full length of the audio, you can try to reload the page. If that does not help, the full length output may still become available a few minutes later, so you can try to reload the page again after five to ten minutes.
